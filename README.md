# Mikey Nodes

This repository contains custom nodes for ComfyUI.

## Empty Latent Ratio Select SDXL

This node allows you to select from a range of different aspect ratios.

## Empty Latent Ratio Custom SDXL

This node allows you to enter your own aspect ratio or image size from wherever, and it will make it fit under 1024x1024 resolution.

## VAE Decode 6GB (deprecated)

This node is a bandaid fix for Mikey's 3060 6GB graphics card to keep VRAM usage below 6GB.

You shouldn't need this anymore since there was an update to comfyui to fix the issue.
